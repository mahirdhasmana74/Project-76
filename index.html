        <h3 style="color: red ;" id="intro1"><b>What is Solar System ?</b></h3>
        <p style="color: aliceblue;">The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. It formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority (99.86%) of the system's mass is in the Sun, with most of the remaining mass contained in the planet Jupiter.</p>

        <h3 style="color: red ;" id="intro1"><b>What is Satellite ?</b></h3>
        <p style="color: aliceblue;">A satellite or artificial satellite is an object intentionally placed into orbit in outer space. Except for passive satellites, most satellites have an electricity generation system for equipment on board, such as solar panels or radioisotope thermoelectric generators. Most satellites also have a method of communication to ground stations, called transponders. Many satellites use a standardized bus to save cost and work, the most popular of which is small CubeSats. Similar satellites can work together as a group, forming constellations. Because of the high launch cost to space, satellites are designed to be as lightweight and robust as possible.</p>

    <h3 style="color: red;">How Rocket Works ?</h3>
    <p class="jumbotron">
        In space, an engine has nothing to push against. So how do rockets move there? Rockets work by a scientific rule called Newton's third law of motion. English scientist Sir Isaac Newton listed three Laws of Motion. He did this more than 300 years ago. His third law says that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. The rocket pushes on its exhaust. The exhaust pushes the rocket, too. The rocket pushes the exhaust backward. The exhaust makes the rocket move forward.
        This rule can be seen on Earth. Imagine a person standing on a skateboard. Imagine that person throwing a bowling ball. The ball will go forward. The person on the skateboard will move, too. The person will move backward. Because the person is heavier, the bowling ball will move farther.

      <h4 style="color: purple; "><u>Runway stars</u></h4>
      <p class="jumbotron">
        One of the best things Satellites have discovered in space are runaway stars; at the very brink of our galaxy, runaway stars have been discovered in a cluster, moving so fast that they have enough energy to escape gravitational clutches.

      <h4 style="color: purple;"><u>Interstellar Visitor</u></h4>
      <p class="jumbotron">
        satellites discovered in space a foreign object, also known as an Interstellar Visitor, in our solar system that came from somewhere else.
        The object was spotted when it was already travelling away from Earth. One of the most peculiar things about this object was the speed at which it was roaming at; in September it was spotted close to the Sun and in October it had already passed Earth by 15 million miles! Covering over 15.8 miles each second, the incredibly speedy object was almost red due to how hot it was.
